# Introduction 
An application using a N-Tier architecture I designed to act as a standard for replaceable frontends supported by various backends. Creating a flexible method of moving applications in and out of the cloud, and serverless scenarios. 

There are 3 projects within this Repo, they are actively managed in Azure DevOps with CI-CD to Azure App Services at the moment. The eventual plan is to stand up versions that support Serverless Function apps, and Docker containers for ease of use.
