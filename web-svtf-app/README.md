# Introduction 
This Project is the primary entrance to the web application that utilizes the API to display information for our end user

# Getting Started
This code WILL NOT be runnable as is due to a library configuration that is currently only available in this applications primary Azure Cloud residence. Once the package can be introduced to Nuget, it can become usable. 

If you did want to run this locally, you would need to remove the Nuget reference to the SVTF API and convert it to a local reference and run both this web app and the API simultaneously.
